# Mail-Delivery-Robot
Intro to Robotics projects
The overall objective of this project is:

* To design a control system,based on Bayesian­localization techniques, for the Turtle­ bot 3 Waffle Pi robot to deliver mail to arbitrarily chosen stations on a closed­loop route.

Refer to **project.pdf** for full project description and path image
* mail_delivery.py contains the ROS code used to execute the projective objective
* bayesian_simulation.py contains code used to visualize state probabiltiy convergence of the closed loop path given the state and measurement model

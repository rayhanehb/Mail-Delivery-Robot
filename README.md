# Mail-Delivery-Robot
Intro to Robotics projects
The overall objective of this project is:

* To design a control system,based on Bayesian­localization techniques, for the Turtle­ bot 3 Waffle Pi robot to deliver mail to arbitrarily chosen stations on a closed­loop route.

Refer to **Final_Report.pdf** for the final writeup and description of the project steps 
* **mail_delivery.py** contains the ROS code used to execute the projective objective
* **bayesian_simulation.py** contains code used to visualize state probabiltiy convergence of the closed loop path given the state and measurement model
* **project.pdf** contains the initial project description pdf
